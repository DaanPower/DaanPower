I'm a programming hobbyist focusing on Python! ðŸ‘‹

Other hobbies of mine include: typing, science, space, mathematics, nature & chess.

I try to even out my time but it doesn't work all the time, so my projects are a little less active.
Also most of my projects are private, so please excuse that!
I am working on making them open-source.

Thank you for reading!
